marin country contemplating how to end this book i would been working on the manuscript for the past eighteen months weaving together material from personal experience and from talks i would given around the country on conscious aging but somehow the book is conclusion had eluded me lying there in the dark i wondered why what i would written seemed so incomplete not quite rounded grounded or whole i tried to imagine what life would be like if i were very old not an active person of sixty five traveling the world incessantly as a teacher and speaker caught up in my public role but as someone of ninety say with failing sight and failing limbs i fantasized how that old man would think how he'd move and speak and hear what desires he might have as he slowly surveyed the world i was trying to feel my way into oldness i was thoroughly enjoying this fantasy when the phone rang in the process of my fantasy i would noticed that my leg seemed to have fallen asleep as i got up to answer the phone my leg gave way under me and i fell to the floor in my mind the fall was still part of my old man fantasy i did not realize that my leg was no longer working because i would had a strokei reached for my phone on the table near my bedr d are you there i heard the voice of an old friend in santa fe when i did not respond coherently he asked are you sick i suppose i still did not answer so he said if you cannot speak tap on the phone tap once for yes and twice for no when he asked whether i wanted help i tapped no over and over againnonetheless he contacted my secretaries who live close by and the next thing i knew they rushed into the house and found me on the floor there i was flat on my back still caught in my dream of the very old man who had now fallen down because his leg wouldn't work my assistants seemed very frightened they called 911 my next recollection is of a group of young firemen straight out of central casting staring into the old man is face while i observed the whole thing as if from a doorway to the side i am told i was immediately rushed to a hospital nearby but all i remember is being rolled down the hospital corridors looking up at the ceiling pipes and the concerned faces of nurses and friends i was fascinated by what was happeningonly afterward did i learn that i had a stroke and realize how close to death i had actually been the doctors told my friends i had a massive cerebral hemorrhage and only a ten percent chance of survival i noticed the looks of deep concern on the faces of the doctors and my friends but the thought of dying was nowhere in my mind so i was perplexed by their grave expressionsthree hospitals and hundreds of hours of rehabilitation later i gradually eased into my new post stroke life as someone in a wheelchair partially paralyzed requiring round the clock care and a degree of personal attention that made me uncomfortable all my life i had been a helper i had even collaborated on a book called how can i help i now found myself forced to accept the help of others and to admit that my body needed attention because i would spent my adult life concentrating on the realms of the spirit i would always been able to rationalize the distance i maintained from my body by saying that my detachment was a spiritual witnessing of the physical form but that had been only partly true the truth is that i distanced myself from my body i saw my body as merely a vehicle for the soul i ignored it as much as possible and tried to spiritualize it awayfrom a physical perspective the lack of love i would shown toward my body contributed to my stroke i was negligent about taking my blood pressure medicine and a month before the stroke ignored an unusual one side hearing loss while scuba diving in the caribbean before the stroke although i was in my 60 is i saw myself as young and powerful with my mg golf clubs surfing and speaking gigs illness had shattered my self image and opened the door to a new chapter in my lifeafter any major physical insult as they call it it is all too easy to see yourself as a collection of symptoms rather than as a total human being including your spirit and thus to become your illness fear is powerful and contagious and at first i allowed myself to catch it worried that if i did not do what the doctors ordered i would be sorry but now i am learning to take my healing into my own hands healing is not the same as curing after all healing does not mean going back to the way things were before but rather allowing what is now to move us closer to godfor example since my speech was severely impaired by this stroke i considered not speaking publicly anymore since the words came so slowly but people insisted that my halting new voice enabled them to concentrate on the silence between the words now that i speak more slowly people tend to finish my sentences for me and thus to answer questions for themselves though i once used silence as a teaching method it now arises without my control and allows for a sense of emptiness an emptiness that listeners can use as a doorway to their inner quietmy guru once said to a visitor complaining about her suffering i love suffering it brings me so close to god in this same way i've learned that the incidents associated with aging including this stroke can be used for our spiritual healing provided we learn to see through new eyesalthough my outward life has been radically altered i do not see myself as a stroke victim i see myself as a soul who is watching him experience the aftermath of this cerebral hemorrhage having accepted my predicament i am much happier than i was before this troubles some of the people around me they have told me that i should fight to walk again but i do not know if i wanted to walk i am sitting that is where i am i am peaceful like this and i am grateful to the people who care for me why is this wrong though i can now stand and move around with a walker i've grown to love my wheelchair i call it my swan boat and being wheeled about by people who care they carry chinese emperors and indian maharajas on palanquins in other cultures it is a symbol of honor and power to be carried and wheeled i do not believe it is all important to be what our culture calls optimalbefore the stroke i wrote a great deal about the terrible things that can happen in aging and how to cope with them now i am happy to say that having gone through what some would view as the worst it is not so bad after allgetting old is not easy for a lot of us neither is living neither is dying we struggle against the inevitable and we all suffer because of it we have to find another way to look at the whole process of being born growing old changing and dying some kind of perspective that might allow us to deal with what we perceive as big obstacles without having to be dragged through the drama it really helps to understand that we have something that we are something which is unchangeable beautiful completely aware and continues no matter what knowing this does not solve everything this is what i encountered and told about in be here now and i've still had my share of suffering but the perspective of the soul can help a lot with the little things and it is my hope that you will be able to take from this book some joy in being still hererecently a friend said to me you are more human since the stroke than you were before this touched me profoundly what a gift the stroke has given me to finally learn that i do not have to renounce my humanity in order to be spiritual that i can be both witness and participant both eternal spirit and aging body the book is ending which had eluded me is now finally clear the stroke has given me a new perspective to share about aging a perspective that says do not be a wise elder be an incarnation of wisdom that changes the whole nature of the game that is not just a new role it is a new state of being it is the real thing at nearly seventy surrounded by people who care for and love me i am still learning to be here now\",\n",
