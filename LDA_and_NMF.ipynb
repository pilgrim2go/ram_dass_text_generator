       " 'Now, when you first start to say a mantra, the first involvement is in hearing it outside, through your ears, saying it aloud and hearing it and thinking about it’s meaning. That’s the first game you play with mantra. So, if I give you that mantra,\\xa0Om Mani Padme Hum,\\xa0you think about it and you think, “Well, what does it mean?” Now, there are many meanings – there’s a whole book written about its meaning by Govinda. One of the ways of understanding its meaning is that\\xa0Om\\xa0means, like Brahma, that which is behind it all, the unmanifest.\\xa0Mani\\xa0means jewel or crystal.\\xa0Padme\\xa0means lotus, and\\xa0Hum\\xa0means heart. So, on one level what it means is the entire universe is just like a pure jewel or crystal right in the heart or center of the lotus flower, which is me, and it is manifest, it comes forth in light, in manifest light, in my own heart. That’s one way of interpreting it. You start to say\\xa0Om Mani Padme Hum\\xa0and you’re thinking, “God in unmanifest form is like a jewel in the middle of a lotus, manifest in my heart.” You go through that and feel it in your heart – that’s one trip.',\n",

Boy, I’ve been on this trip!” Instead of that, all of that stuff, which is terribly profound and important, but isn’t really that relevant, you go into the mantra. Once the mantra has been going on that way for a while, it starts to change in its nature. You stop thinking about what it means; you just sort of get hooked or addicted on the Tibetan sound of it. And then it starts to move into your head, and then from your head down into your chest, until pretty soon it’s going around like a little wheel, going around inside your chest, just\\xa0Om Mani Padme Hum, right?',\n",

Any time you want to bring it back into consciousness, you can rerun its meaning, which will do that thing for you again, but you can keep it down in the place where it’s just running off. Now it’s got another quality to it. That is, when a mantra is done sufficiently it gets into a certain kind of vibration or harmony with the universe in a certain way which is its own thing. The conscious beings who evolve certain languages such as Sanskrit specifically evolve the sounds of these languages to be connected with various states of consciousness – unlike the English language- so that a Sanskrit mantra, if you do it over and over again, will take you to a certain state of consciousness.',\n",

It is present and encompasses all our thoughts, feelings, and sensations; yet it is not the same as them. To recognize and acknowledge this awareness, with its spacious, peaceful quality, is to find a very useful resource within.

And there is a way in which deny- ing too much stops flow. There are a lot of people who are really good meditators, who sit perfectly and their minds get very quiet.

       " 'If I understand this game at all, it’s a game of exquisite balancing. And the balancing can be understood within different systems. For example, in southern Buddhist meditation, Theravada Buddhist meditation there are three components that are emphasized. One is called sila, one is called samadhi, and one is called panna. Sila is the purification: non-killing, non-stealing, non-lying, right speech, mindfulness. And panna is right understanding and right thought, or the wisdom connected with it. Now if we watch the way the game works with those three components – purification, concentration and wisdom-we’ll see that we wouldn’t even start this dance without a little bit of wisdom. We have to understand a little bit of what the game is about even to want to sit and meditate. So we have a little bit of panna, and then we try to do samadhi, concentration. But every time we try to concentrate, all of our other desires, all of our other connections and clingings to the world keep pulling on us all the time. So we have to clean up our game a little bit; that’s called sila, purification. We clean up our game a little bit, and then our meditation gets a little deeper. As our meditation gets a little deeper, we are quieter and we are able to see more of the universe so that wisdom gets deeper and we understand more. The deeper panna makes it easier to let go of some of the attachments, so it makes it easier to increase the sila. And the increased sila allows the samadhi to get deeper. So, we begin to see the way these three things all keep inter- weaving with one another. They’re a beautiful balancing act.',\n",

Start to relate to your desires as something you can scrutinize rather than as things that totally suck you in all the time, things that consume you.

I had seen her as a Jewish middle-class woman filling the role of mother with all her personality things. But that person is all gone. So he said that about her, and I asked the translator to clarify whether he meant to say “is” or “was.” So, the translator went back over, and Maharaji got angry and said, “Is!… Is!”',\n",

So my mother and I were both at the farm, and I took the call, and there was silence. You see though, my mother paid the bills on that telephone, and so she said, “Do your friends have to call collect?” I said, “That’s alright that he did that. You know, I have one category in my life, and that is friend. My friends treat me with respect, and I treat them with respect, and if I tell him to call, I must have a reason. And I find that I’m only happy with friends. So what do you think? You think we could be friends?” She walked up to bed and about half an hour later I went up to her bedroom and she was reading.

       " 'My interest in aging came from a personal direction: I was getting older — and so were the baby boomers, who were fast approaching fifty. In this youth-oriented culture, aging is a profound source of suffering, and that is what I was responding to when I decided to turn my attention to conscious aging workshops, and to writing this book.One evening in February 1997, I was in bed at home in Marin Country, contemplating how to end this book. I’d been working on the manuscript for the past eighteen months, weaving together material from personal experience and from talks I’d given around the country on conscious aging, but somehow the book’s conclusion had eluded me. Lying there in the dark, I wondered why what I’d written seemed so incomplete, not quite rounded, grounded, or whole. I tried to imagine what life would be like if I were very old — not an active person of sixty-five, traveling the world incessantly as a teacher and speaker, caught up in my public role — but as someone of ninety, say, with failing sight and failing limbs. I fantasized how that old man would think, how he’d move and speak and hear, what desires he might have as he slowly surveyed the world. I was trying to feel my way into oldness. I was thoroughly enjoying this fantasy when the phone rang. In the process of my fantasy, I’d noticed that my leg seemed to have fallen asleep. As I got up to answer the phone, my leg gave way under me and I fell to the floor. In my mind, the fall was still part of my “old-man fantasy.” I didn’t realize that my leg was no longer working because I’d had a stroke.I reached for my phone, on the table near my bed.“R. D.? Are you there?”I heard the voice of an old friend in Santa Fe. When I didn’t respond coherently, he asked, “Are you sick?” I suppose I still didn’t answer, so he said, “If you can’t speak, tap on the phone. Tap once for yes and twice for no.” When he asked whether I wanted help, I tapped “no” over and over again.Nonetheless, he contacted my secretaries, who live close by, and the next thing I knew they rushed into the house and found me on the floor. There I was flat on my back, still caught in my “dream” of the very old man, who had now fallen down because his leg wouldn’t work. My assistants seemed very frightened; they called 911. My next recollection is of a group of young firemen, straight out of central casting, staring into the old man’s face while I observed the whole thing as if from a doorway to the side. I’m told I was immediately rushed to a hospital nearby, but all I remember is being rolled down the hospital corridors, looking up at the ceiling pipes and the concerned faces of nurses and friends. I was fascinated by what was happening.Only afterward did I learn that I had a stroke and realize how close to death I had actually been. The doctors told my friends I had a massive cerebral hemorrhage, and only a ten percent chance of survival. I noticed the looks of deep concern on the faces of the doctors and my friends, but the thought of dying was nowhere in my mind, so I was perplexed by their grave expressions.Three hospitals and hundreds of hours of rehabilitation later, I gradually eased into my new post-stroke life as someone in a wheelchair, partially paralyzed, requiring round-the-clock care and a degree of personal attention that made me uncomfortable. All my life I had been a “helper”; I had even collaborated on a book called “How Can I Help?” I now found myself forced to accept the help of others, and to admit that my body needed attention. Because I’d spent my adult life concentrating on the realms of the spirit, I’d always been able to rationalize the distance I maintained from my body by saying that my detachment was a spiritual witnessing of the physical form. But that had been only partly true. The truth is that I distanced myself from my body. I saw my body as merely a vehicle for the soul. I ignored it as much as possible and tried to spiritualize it away.From a physical perspective, the lack of love I’d shown toward my body contributed to my stroke. I was negligent about taking my blood pressure medicine and, a month before the stroke, ignored an unusual one-side hearing loss while scuba diving in the Caribbean. Before the stroke, although I was in my 60’s, I saw myself as young and powerful, with my MG, golf clubs, surfing, and speaking gigs. Illness had shattered my self-image, and opened the door to a new chapter in my life.After any major physical “insult,” as they call it, it’s all too easy to see yourself as a collection of symptoms rather than as a total human being, including your spirit — and thus to become your illness. Fear is powerful and contagious, and at first I allowed myself to catch it, worried that if I didn’t do what the doctors ordered, I’d be sorry. But now I’m learning to take my healing into my own hands. Healing is not the same as curing, after all; healing does not mean going back to the way things were before, but rather allowing what is now to move us closer to God.For example, since my speech was severely impaired by this stroke, I considered not speaking publicly anymore, since the words came so slowly, but people insisted that my halting new voice enabled them to concentrate on the silence between the words. Now that I speak more slowly, people tend to finish my sentences for me, and thus to answer questions for themselves. Though I once used silence as a teaching method, it now arises without my control and allows for a sense of emptiness, an emptiness that listeners can use as a doorway to their inner quiet.My guru once said to a visitor complaining about her suffering, “I love suffering. It brings me so close to God.” In this same way, I’ve learned that the incidents associated with aging — including this stroke — can be used for our spiritual healing, provided we learn to see through new eyes.Although my outward life has been radically altered, I don’t see myself as a stroke victim. I see myself as a Soul who’s watching “him” experience the aftermath of this cerebral hemorrhage. Having accepted my predicament, I’m much happier than I was before. This troubles some of the people around me. They have told me that I should fight to walk again, but I don’t know if I wanted to walk. I’m sitting — that’s where I am. I’m peaceful like this and I am grateful to the people who care for me. Why is this wrong? Though I can now stand and move around with a walker, I’ve grown to love my wheelchair (I call it my swan boat) and being wheeled about by people who care. They carry Chinese emperors and Indian maharajas on palanquins; in other cultures, it’s a symbol of honor and power to be carried and wheeled. I don’t believe it’s all-important to be what our culture calls “optimal.”Before the stroke I wrote a great deal about the terrible things that can happen in aging, and how to cope with them. Now I’m happy to say that having gone through what some would view as the worst, it’s not so bad after all.Getting old isn’t easy for a lot of us. Neither is living, neither is dying. We struggle against the inevitable, and we all suffer because of it. We have to find another way to look at the whole process of being born, growing old, changing, and dying, some kind of perspective that might allow us to deal with what we perceive as big obstacles without having to be dragged through the drama. It really helps to understand that we have something — that we are something — which is unchangeable, beautiful, completely aware, and continues no matter what. Knowing this doesn’t solve everything — this is what I encountered and told about in “Be Here Now,” and I’ve still had my share of suffering. But the perspective of the soul can help a lot with the little things, and it is my hope that you’ll be able to take from this book some joy in being “still here.”Recently, a friend said to me, “You’re more human since the stroke than you were before.” This touched me profoundly. What a gift the stroke has given me, to finally learn that I don’t have to renounce my humanity in order to be spiritual — that I can be both witness and participant, both eternal spirit and aging body. The book’s ending, which had eluded me, is now finally clear. The stroke has given me a new perspective to share about aging, a perspective that says, “Don’t be a wise elder, be an incarnation of wisdom.” That changes the whole nature of the game. That’s not just a new role; it’s a new state of being. It’s the real thing. At nearly seventy, surrounded by people who care for and love me, I’m still learning to be here now.',\n",

I identify with the witness, and the witness is the spiritual heart. In this play of consciousness that you and I are talking about, you start from your head and go down to your spiritual heart. What we can see is on this physical plane. Now come into the spiritual heart, and you delve into another plane of consciousness, which is the soul. Then if you go further inside, if you go deep enough, you go through one more plane, the plane of oneness. Then all that fighting will stop because it’s all one.

I am loving awareness.” When you finish that exercise, you are loving awareness. When you meet people in the street and they ask who you are, you don’t say, “I am loving awareness.” That would be shocking to them, so you say your name, but inside you know you are loving awareness.

And you say, “Oh that’s a grey square.” Everybody looks and says it’s a grey square. If you had it framed properly, you’d say, “Oh that’s a cloud.” So I guess what you do is reframe your painting. So there is some part of you that notices you being the experiencer of pain. Ah, there I am being addicted to the experience of pain again. How poignant! There are ways, for example, of using the pain to go beyond the pain, to feel the shape of the pain, feel its intensity, feel its qualities, become friends with the pain. And then there’s the other method of surrounding the pain with space in which the space is one percent of the time and the pain is 99 percent of the time. And then very slowly there’s a shift in balance over time. I have sat with people in pain and meditated, allowing the whole psychological domain of that pain, opening to it, and then seeing the person come out of pain, out of being the experiencer of pain into another place. Pain is one of the toughest to work with. But after all, who promised you a rose garden? And you work with what you can and if you can’t you take something to stop the pain. No big deal.

And finally, there is a place in you that tastes truth because it feels so relaxed and so eternal and so nothing special. Pretty soon your mind imitates it almost exactly but it has a lack of a living quality about it and you will find that as long as you cling to any quality of highness at all, you will keep doing that.

And as you accept your responsibility for the creating of the karmic field, or the manifestation, you become very much like the male force in form, so that actually all of us are both female-receptive and male-assertive. It’s interesting that saints often, as years go by, begin to take on qualities that seem very androgynous. Gayness is just another way of manifesting. When one stands back far enough, one sees that just the way the biological dance has been designed and the way male’s bodies and female’s bodies are designed and the whole idea of maintenance of the species suggests that gayness may not be the optimum way of physically relating to the universe. But it is what it is. Too many people that are gay have spent too much time being preoccupied with their pathology, or protesting that they aren’t pathological, or being busy defining themselves in terms of their sexual identity. It’s like alcoholics being busy being ex-alcoholics if they are in AA. Intimacy with another human being is intimacy and searching through that intimacy to experience a oneness of awareness is searching of soul with soul. People shouldn’t make such a big deal about all of their individual differences. It’s just the way the cards were dealt in that incarnation for whatever karmic reasons you had in mind in creating it in the first place. There’s no one to blame. If your mother smothered you with love that’s what she did because she loved you. You just start to allow it and you work with it because you can get to God standing on one finger eating a steak.

I don’t think they are universal but they are certainly better than chance and those personality constellations make those kinds of people attracted to certain kinds of spiritual practices and not to others, just like everybody. Everybody has a karmic predicament which leads them to a certain doorway; what’s a doorway through for one person is a blank wall to somebody else. People that are part of minority groups, who have been badly persecuted, very often are spending most of their life fighting that persecution and that’s really what their work is in this lifetime. They get born into a minority group that was being persecuted and that becomes their crusade and that’s their vehicle; it’s not a vehicle necessarily that will finish the job in one birth but it’s what is real to them. Often, that kind of an adversity of being deviant or a minority group is a lot of the sandpaper or fire which forces a turning inward and a deepening which is not available to somebody who has got all of the cards. The winning hand is so easily the losing hand. Often you see somebody who is incredibly beautiful or very rich and you end up feeling sorry for them. Because their symbolic value is so strong nobody can see through it. And they could be starving to death in there.

That’s why the Bible enjoins, “Thou shalt not lust.” It doesn’t say, “Thou shalt not have sex or enjoy it.” It says, “Thou shalt not lust.” Thou shalt not get caught in seeing other human beings exclusively as objects, nor to deny that we have senses and endocrine systems and they awaken under certain conditions and not under others and that’s just the way it is.

It’s not our job to decide whether they should be. They have a right to it. And I think each of us more and more becomes an instrument for that in whatever light we see it, in the way we can. We have to honor and respect each other’s ways of doing it. But I think that doesn’t mean we have to judge everything else in the world. Because God manifests in many and complex patterns. And if you’re going to free the world of the polarization of love and hate, you have to enter into a space of allowing the universe to be. And then your vibration doesn’t polarize the world.

One of the things I do is to encourage people to be very human, to not deny their grief, or their fear of loss, at the same moment not to walk away from it. I also suggest to them that they don’t lay any trips on the person who’s dying as to how they ought to die because how can you decide how a person ought to die? So, that sometimes you’re with a person who doesn’t want to admit they are dying. And that’s perfectly all right, they have a right to do that.

Often times people get very frightened and they pull back, back into breath or back into normal waking consciousness. My suggestion is to go up as close as you can and hang out as much as you can, and when it gets too heavy, pull back. I think that it is also good to focus on that which allows you to feel your own being, getting rid of the fear, because that tends to make the fear more real. Then go back and check if it’s still around. Finally you treat the fear like an old friend who’s come by for tea. “Oh, you’re here again. Come on in.” I’m human, I’m afraid, I’m also separate. I’m not only the One, I’m the many — separate and afraid to die and afraid of being victimized, afraid of being hurt by opening up to love and then having someone turn away, afraid in a million ways.

Sometimes you work with your strong suit until your faith gets so clear and strong that you can start to focus in on the places you’ve been pushing away. That’s what happened with me. And very often what you find out at point B that turns out to be your particular route through was something that back at point A you were rejecting.

Then you come back to this culture where you have quote ‘an aging problem,’ a struggle when it comes to embracing aging. And I realized we are gathered here because of our cultural pathology. That were it not for that we wouldn’t need this so much because in many cultures this was all built in, in a natural way and in our zeal to be independent, we have thrown away the baby with the bath a little bit.

So I would take the kind of internalized feeling and thought, and I would bring my awareness back to my breath, and then the thought would come again, and I would go back to my breath, and then the thought would come again, and again I would come back to my breath, until eventually I started to appreciate it as just another thought, because at this point I am treating it like that, rather than like it is ‘real’ or ‘solid.’',\n",

He’s talking about higher consciousness; he’s telling us who we really are. He’s telling us what it means when you start to be born again, when you suddenly start to have faith in another possibility. Now what is that called, what is the other possibility? It’s just a vibrational rate. It’s like you’re born with a pre-fixed setting on your television set to channel nine and you never even knew there was a channel seven, channel five, four, two. So everybody that comes along and says “Were you tuned into channel seven last night?” You look at them with a certain pity. Don’t they know there’s only channel nine? Don’t they know how it really is? And then something happens, and it touches a place in you that’s been there all the time and it’s as if you wake for a moment from a long sleep and you say “Oh! Wow!

It is not enough to admire from afar the qualities of kindness and compassion as being noble ideas, but somewhat removed from our daily lives. It is not enough to cultivate them only in the solitude of a meditation retreat. Our practice is about the transformation of consciousness that makes compassionate responsiveness the default setting of our lives.',\n",

It means learning to simply be with the truth of things as they are. This is the great gift of mindfulness that opens us to compassion. Being with the truth of what is present is what we do every time we open to our own pain or difficulty.

       " \"my interest in aging came from a personal direction i was getting older and so were the baby boomers who were fast approaching fifty in this youth oriented culture aging is a profound source of suffering and that is what i was responding to when i decided to turn my attention to conscious aging workshops and to writing this bookone evening in february 1997 i was in bed at home in marin country contemplating how to end this book i would been working on the manuscript for the past eighteen months weaving together material from personal experience and from talks i would given around the country on conscious aging but somehow the book is conclusion had eluded me lying there in the dark i wondered why what i would written seemed so incomplete not quite rounded grounded or whole i tried to imagine what life would be like if i were very old not an active person of sixty five traveling the world incessantly as a teacher and speaker caught up in my public role but as someone of ninety say with failing sight and failing limbs i fantasized how that old man would think how he'd move and speak and hear what desires he might have as he slowly surveyed the world i was trying to feel my way into oldness i was thoroughly enjoying this fantasy when the phone rang in the process of my fantasy i would noticed that my leg seemed to have fallen asleep as i got up to answer the phone my leg gave way under me and i fell to the floor in my mind the fall was still part of my old man fantasy i did not realize that my leg was no longer working because i would had a strokei reached for my phone on the table near my bedr d are you there i heard the voice of an old friend in santa fe when i did not respond coherently he asked are you sick i suppose i still did not answer so he said if you cannot speak tap on the phone tap once for yes and twice for no when he asked whether i wanted help i tapped no over and over againnonetheless he contacted my secretaries who live close by and the next thing i knew they rushed into the house and found me on the floor there i was flat on my back still caught in my dream of the very old man who had now fallen down because his leg wouldn't work my assistants seemed very frightened they called 911 my next recollection is of a group of young firemen straight out of central casting staring into the old man is face while i observed the whole thing as if from a doorway to the side i am told i was immediately rushed to a hospital nearby but all i remember is being rolled down the hospital corridors looking up at the ceiling pipes and the concerned faces of nurses and friends i was fascinated by what was happeningonly afterward did i learn that i had a stroke and realize how close to death i had actually been the doctors told my friends i had a massive cerebral hemorrhage and only a ten percent chance of survival i noticed the looks of deep concern on the faces of the doctors and my friends but the thought of dying was nowhere in my mind so i was perplexed by their grave expressionsthree hospitals and hundreds of hours of rehabilitation later i gradually eased into my new post stroke life as someone in a wheelchair partially paralyzed requiring round the clock care and a degree of personal attention that made me uncomfortable all my life i had been a helper i had even collaborated on a book called how can i help i now found myself forced to accept the help of others and to admit that my body needed attention because i would spent my adult life concentrating on the realms of the spirit i would always been able to rationalize the distance i maintained from my body by saying that my detachment was a spiritual witnessing of the physical form but that had been only partly true the truth is that i distanced myself from my body i saw my body as merely a vehicle for the soul i ignored it as much as possible and tried to spiritualize it awayfrom a physical perspective the lack of love i would shown toward my body contributed to my stroke i was negligent about taking my blood pressure medicine and a month before the stroke ignored an unusual one side hearing loss while scuba diving in the caribbean before the stroke although i was in my 60 is i saw myself as young and powerful with my mg golf clubs surfing and speaking gigs illness had shattered my self image and opened the door to a new chapter in my lifeafter any major physical insult as they call it it is all too easy to see yourself as a collection of symptoms rather than as a total human being including your spirit and thus to become your illness fear is powerful and contagious and at first i allowed myself to catch it worried that if i did not do what the doctors ordered i would be sorry but now i am learning to take my healing into my own hands healing is not the same as curing after all healing does not mean going back to the way things were before but rather allowing what is now to move us closer to godfor example since my speech was severely impaired by this stroke i considered not speaking publicly anymore since the words came so slowly but people insisted that my halting new voice enabled them to concentrate on the silence between the words now that i speak more slowly people tend to finish my sentences for me and thus to answer questions for themselves though i once used silence as a teaching method it now arises without my control and allows for a sense of emptiness an emptiness that listeners can use as a doorway to their inner quietmy guru once said to a visitor complaining about her suffering i love suffering it brings me so close to god in this same way i've learned that the incidents associated with aging including this stroke can be used for our spiritual healing provided we learn to see through new eyesalthough my outward life has been radically altered i do not see myself as a stroke victim i see myself as a soul who is watching him experience the aftermath of this cerebral hemorrhage having accepted my predicament i am much happier than i was before this troubles some of the people around me they have told me that i should fight to walk again but i do not know if i wanted to walk i am sitting that is where i am i am peaceful like this and i am grateful to the people who care for me why is this wrong though i can now stand and move around with a walker i've grown to love my wheelchair i call it my swan boat and being wheeled about by people who care they carry chinese emperors and indian maharajas on palanquins in other cultures it is a symbol of honor and power to be carried and wheeled i do not believe it is all important to be what our culture calls optimalbefore the stroke i wrote a great deal about the terrible things that can happen in aging and how to cope with them now i am happy to say that having gone through what some would view as the worst it is not so bad after allgetting old is not easy for a lot of us neither is living neither is dying we struggle against the inevitable and we all suffer because of it we have to find another way to look at the whole process of being born growing old changing and dying some kind of perspective that might allow us to deal with what we perceive as big obstacles without having to be dragged through the drama it really helps to understand that we have something that we are something which is unchangeable beautiful completely aware and continues no matter what knowing this does not solve everything this is what i encountered and told about in be here now and i've still had my share of suffering but the perspective of the soul can help a lot with the little things and it is my hope that you will be able to take from this book some joy in being still hererecently a friend said to me you are more human since the stroke than you were before this touched me profoundly what a gift the stroke has given me to finally learn that i do not have to renounce my humanity in order to be spiritual that i can be both witness and participant both eternal spirit and aging body the book is ending which had eluded me is now finally clear the stroke has given me a new perspective to share about aging a perspective that says do not be a wise elder be an incarnation of wisdom that changes the whole nature of the game that is not just a new role it is a new state of being it is the real thing at nearly seventy surrounded by people who care for and love me i am still learning to be here now\",\n",

       " 'the struggles of those we are helping confront us with life at its purest their suffering strips away guile and leaves what is real and essential the deepest human qualities come forth openness yearning patience courage forebearance faith humor living truth living spirit moved and touched by these qualities we have no choice but to acknowledge and reaffirm our humanity others notice when this happens we feel them feel it it is at these moments that we remember what service is truly all about',\n",
       " 'compassion arises out of our willingness to come close to suffering the problem is that even though we may want to be compassionate and perhaps often are it is not always easy to open to the suffering that is present and just as there are many times when we do not want to acknowledge and open to our own pain we do not necessarily want to be with the pain of others',\n",
       " 'there are strong tendencies in the mind that keep us defended withdrawn indifferent or apathetic in the face of suffering this indifference is often unacknowledged and is a great barrier to a compassionate response',\n",
       " 'as an experiment watch your mind the next time you approach a situation of suffering it might be some pain in the body or some emotional distress like discontent fear unworthiness jealousy or loneliness it might be an interaction with a difficult person or a situation of suffering in the world – situations of racial injustice political or religious violence or of natural disasters what happens as we face these situations either in person or through the vivid images of the media do we feel uneasy do we withdraw do we numb ourselves do we let it in ',\n",
       " 'the question for us is how can our hearts stay open given the magnitude of suffering that exists in the world is it even possible to open to it all with compassion diminishing the subtle cruelty of indifference the challenge is not a theoretical one it is not enough to admire from afar the qualities of kindness and compassion as being noble ideas but somewhat removed from our daily lives it is not enough to cultivate them only in the solitude of a meditation retreat our practice is about the transformation of consciousness that makes compassionate responsiveness the default setting of our lives',\n",
       " 'compassion requires both openness and equanimity it requires learning to let things in without drowning in the difficulties and without being overcome by sorrow it means learning to simply be with the truth of things as they are this is the great gift of mindfulness that opens us to compassion being with the truth of what is present is what we do every time we open to our own pain or difficulty as we practice opening to and coming close to the suffering in our own lives with compassion we then have greater strength and courage to be with the suffering of others',\n",
       " 'luck is what happens when fate gets tired of waiting',\n",
       " 'i feel sadhana comes from the real self sadhana goes from head which is the ego to heart which is the real self and this is the soul in the depth of the soul is the atman the oversoul and that oversoul is really love and compassion peace joy and wisdom but that is not just knowledge it is much more',\n",
       " 'the soul is not ruled by time and space the soul is infinite it blends with the one in infinity i am talking to you but that is only one level and you and i are one so one is talking to self it is another level these are planes of consciousness and i think human beings exist on two planes of consciousness the soul and the ego',\n",
       " 'the soul is not part of the incarnation it comes into the incarnation and the soul is not afraid of death because it has done it so many times and now the ego is individual and the world at this moment is ruled by nations which are egos and i find for example that the united nations is very ineffective but then what would we substitute we could substitute wise beings from different religions or different states philosopher kings if you will',\n",
       " 'if you want oneness in society you have to teach people to go inside instead of going outside because if they want peace they need to find it within i remember being at a peace rally everybody was yelling peace peace that is not peace peace is inside in me and in everybody else if you want peace you go down in',\n",
       " 'when you concentrate on the middle of your chest this is where loving awareness lives this is the spiritual heart not the beating heart not the emotional heart this spiritual heart goes way back goes back many incarnations we call it the soul you come into the individual soul and that is not the end of it you go through that to the atman which is a deeper plane of consciousness so the head is one plane of consciousness the heart has two planes of consciousness and points to his solar plexus there are three planes of consciousness',\n",
       " 'when i went from head to heart everything was love i was so excited to leave behind the ego and all that fear and anxiety but i was still an individual in a sea of love from stage two to threewe become love lose individuality we disappear you are it',\n",
       " 'when i started realizing that one in me that one as me i kept saying i am home i am home and i had just begun to notice that the home is inside this heart is the treasure that we all have yet when i was teaching at harvard i did not know it that was my cross that is our cross',\n",
       " 'heart witnesses the incarnation it witnesses the thoughts i can witness my thoughts you can too most people identify with their thoughts but you have got to bring it down to identify with the witness of your thoughts the past and the future are thoughts nothing but thoughts',\n",
       " 'now when i want to get rid of a thought what happens because they feed on negative energy i cannot just say or think go away i usually love them i love the negative thoughts just love them i love them all i love the wall',\n",
       " 'i am the ego i am the soul for example i went to india to meet my guru now i would say to somebody you will meet your guru when you are inside that is what ramana maharishi said god guru and self are together the ego is a tool you do not separate it it is a tool for the spirit',\n",
       " 'i feel privileged that i have maharaji as a traveling companion he is with me all the time of my life i know he is around because i feel presence and then i go to my imagination and we talk he inhabits my imagination it is like talking to buddha and jesus having that perception in my life is brilliant because my ego does not have a chance you find a resonance with the one inside you',\n",
       " 'when i look at souls flowering it is like a field it is beautiful it is beautiful and i am helping that flowering as my path to god',\n",
       " 'in fact what is happening is the satsang spiritual community is evolving the satsang is within the mass culture like little mushrooms here and there and somebody maybe a christian and a hindu and a buddhist come together does not matter because those are paths they are paths to the one but those satsangs are what the world needs and as i say heart to heart that is what satsang is',\n",
       " 'if we are in heart one then we would finish with the kali yoga we would a have new life a new era i realize that when i am talking to people i know they are all egos and they are all souls by mirroring their souls i want to get them to an identification with their souls if we come together in the right way you you you we will experience love for each other and that is the one',\n",
       " 'grace is here it is here',\n",
       " 'now if i come with eyes that are tuned to other planes of consciousness and if i can center and not get lost in my old reactions to a situation suddenly there it all is living spirit again i think that we are all being prepared all of us to serve in that capacity of reinvesting our society with living spirit and that happens through our becoming living spirit because the only thing you really transmit to another person is your being the fancy words do not mean a thing',\n",
       " 'when we were born we come into the world we come from being fully at home and feeling that release that comes we have a little shadow of it when we come home at the end of the day those of you that have a home and put your feet up or relax or have a cup of tea or whatever that feeling is of coming home or coming to a safe space or feeling back at peace with one when we get separated from that that separation is created by the mind it is the route of suffering that buddha keeps pointing out the clinging of the mind to things which separate one from all of it once that separation has occurred there is incredible pain we can call it being thrown out of the garden of eden we can call it original sin whatever you want to call it there are different metaphors within different systems but there is incredible pain and in some profound way all of our actions henceforth are an attempt to return to that coming back into one',\n",
       " 'we develop a whole set of techniques that make us feel good give us a feeling for the moment of yeah ahhhh and some of those give us that moment so intensely and the rest of our life is so much pain of our separateness and so devoid of that feeling that once we find one of those things it could be any number of things that when that occurs and it works it reinforces the behaviour and you start to do that behaviour more and more because it feels good it takes away the pain of the separateness and the use of drugs the use of material possessions the use of relationships all of it when you get busy and get obsessed with relationships and want to get closer and closer to somebody it is trying to get to the place where you come back into that oneness it is that yearning and you can feel it permeate the universe of people is consciousness',\n",
